# Teensy audio library extension
This is a arduino library, which contains an implementation of the protocol as input and output blocks for the teensy audio library, as well as arduino sketches and auxiliary blocks for several example modules listed below. The library can easily be imported with the zip file and the following guide: https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries/.

## Modules
All example modules use 2.54mm (0.1 inch) pitch perboard with a height of 100mm to hold the electronic components. The connections between the components are made with wires. For overvoltage protection the voltage clamping PCB is used. If +12/-12v is used as the main power supply, each module requires a 5v voltage regulator. Note that in most cases this can be a cheap switching regulator, as noise free power isn't required for most modules.
