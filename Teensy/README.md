# Teensy audio library extension
## TeensyDigitalModularExtension
This folder is a arduino library, which contains an implementation of the protocol as input and output blocks for the teensy audio library, as well as arduino sketches and auxiliary blocks for several example modules listed below. The library can easily be imported with the zip file and the following guide: https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries/.

## PCB
This folder contains PCBs as well as panel designs for the example modules. All PCBs use 2.54mm spacing between components, which means you can also build these modules on perfboard and connect the components with wire, instead of ordering PCBs
